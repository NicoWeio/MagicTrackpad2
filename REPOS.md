- [torvalds/linux ‚Üí /drivers/hid/hid-magicmouse.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/hid/hid-magicmouse.c)
  - the mainline driver you're probably using right now
  <!-- - supports USB and Bluetooth -->
  - ‚ú® supports battery level reporting
  <!-- - does not support host click / ‚Ä¶ -->

  - aka [robotrovsky/Linux-Magic-Trackpad-2-Driver](https://github.com/robotrovsky/Linux-Magic-Trackpad-2-Driver)
  - was [mainlined](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/9d7b18668956c411a422d04c712994c5fdb23a4b) in 2018 (see above)
  - untouched since 5 years, so outdated compared to mainline

- [ponyfleisch/hid-magictrackpad2](https://github.com/ponyfleisch/hid-magictrackpad2)
  <!-- - completely different code -->
  - ‚ú® supports host click and click sensitivity
  - ‚ú® supports ‚Äúforce clicks‚Äù
    - haptic feedback as expected
    - supposed to emulate a middle click, but doesn't work as-is
  - üõë does not support USB
  - compilation requires a small change as of Linux 5.15
    - from: `hid_register_report(hdev, HID_INPUT_REPORT, 0x31);`
    - to: `hid_register_report(hdev, HID_INPUT_REPORT, 0x31, 0);`
  <!-- - code looks clean -->
  - claims to be based heavily on [mwyborski/Linux-Magic-Trackpad-2-Driver](https://github.com/mwyborski/Linux-Magic-Trackpad-2-Driver) (see above) and [robbi5/magictrackpad2-dkms](https://github.com/robbi5/magictrackpad2-dkms) (see below)
  - author considers [mwyborski/Linux-Magic-Trackpad-2-Driver](https://github.com/mwyborski/Linux-Magic-Trackpad-2-Driver) (see above) superior [¬π](https://github.com/ponyfleisch/hid-magictrackpad2/issues/4#issuecomment-394312796)
